## Hut

Hut is a boilerplate for ES6+ syntax. It comes with babel that transpiles ES6+ to ES5 and webpack as build tool.

### Requirements

Hut needs `node` and `npm` to be installed on your machine.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn OR npm install` command to download and install all Webpack dependencies.
3. Run `yarn serve` to run the server on `http://localhost:8080`. This command will run the project in development mode.
4. To build the project for production run `yarn build:prod OR npm run build:prod` command. This will build the app for production and put all the files in `/dist` folder.
5. To run production ready version on local environment, run `yarn serve:prod OR npm run serve:prod`. Then go to `http://localhost:8080`.
